    <!-- Here's how the game works -->
    the user presses a letter
    the program checks to see if it's in a word inside the array
       is the letter exists, the win counter increments

       if the letter is not found, the loss counter increments
    
    The number of tries decrements

    the letters tried are displayed onscreen

    letters found are displayed onscreen

    When 



the Pseudo code
        declare input variable (keyVar)
        create array of names of songs from library (songArray)
        create asset library of songs and pix
        create function to increment win counter
        create function to increment loss counter
        create function to decrement tries remaining counter
        create function to capture keyChoice
        compare keyChoice input to songArray
        Function: Evaluator     {
        if keyVar = an element in songArray
           increment win
        else
           increment loss
        decrement tries remaining
        }
        If win, play song and display image
        When tries remaining = 0, alert "Game Over"

        Note:
        
        once a user has pressed a letter during a try, if they press it again, nothing happens.

        When a round is over, the letters pressed array resets to 0
